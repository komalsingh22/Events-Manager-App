# Verification Steps for Club Admin Event Creation Fix

## Issue Fixed
When a new user signs up as a club admin, they were unable to create events because no clubId was assigned during signup, resulting in the error: "You must be associated with a club to create events."

## Changes Made
Modified `lib/screens/auth/signup_screen.dart` to:
1. Load available clubs from ClubService during initialization
2. Show a club dropdown selector when "Club Admin" role is selected
3. Require club admins to select a club before completing signup
4. Pass the selected clubId to the auth service during signup

## Manual Verification Steps

### Test Case 1: New Club Admin Signup Flow
1. Launch the app
2. Navigate to the signup screen
3. Fill in basic information (name, email, password)
4. Select "Club Admin" as the account type
5. **Verify:** A "Select Your Club" dropdown appears
6. Select a club from the dropdown (e.g., "Tech Club")
7. Complete signup
8. **Expected Result:** User is successfully created with the selected clubId

### Test Case 2: Create Event as New Club Admin
1. Sign up as a club admin (following Test Case 1)
2. Navigate to the dashboard or create event screen
3. Fill in all event details (title, description, location, dates, capacity, category)
4. Click "Save"
5. **Expected Result:** Event is created successfully without the clubId error
6. **Verify:** Event appears in the event list with the correct club association

### Test Case 3: Role Change Behavior
1. Start signup process
2. Select "Club Admin" role
3. Select a club from dropdown
4. Change role to "Student"
5. **Verify:** Club dropdown disappears
6. Change role back to "Club Admin"
7. **Verify:** Club dropdown reappears but selection is reset (user must select again)

### Test Case 4: Club Dropdown Validation
1. Start signup process
2. Fill in all fields
3. Select "Club Admin" role
4. Do NOT select a club
5. Try to submit the form
6. **Expected Result:** Validation error appears: "Please select a club"

### Test Case 5: Existing Club Admin Users
1. Login with existing club admin accounts:
   - tech.club@university.edu (already has clubId: '1')
   - sports.club@university.edu (already has clubId: '2')
2. Try to create an event
3. **Expected Result:** Events can be created successfully (these users already have clubIds)

## Code Review Checklist
- [x] Club selector only appears for Club Admin role
- [x] Clubs are loaded asynchronously with loading state
- [x] Validation ensures club admins select a club
- [x] Club selection is reset when role changes away from Club Admin
- [x] clubId is passed to auth service only for Club Admin role
- [x] Loading state shows spinner while clubs are being fetched
- [x] Empty state message shown if no clubs are available

## Edge Cases Handled
1. **No clubs available:** Shows error message "No clubs available. Please contact an administrator."
2. **Clubs loading:** Shows a loading spinner while clubs are being fetched
3. **Role change:** Clears club selection when switching away from Club Admin role
4. **Validation:** Prevents form submission without club selection for Club Admins
5. **Other roles:** Students and Super Admins do not need to select a club

## Files Modified
- `lib/screens/auth/signup_screen.dart` - Added club selection functionality
